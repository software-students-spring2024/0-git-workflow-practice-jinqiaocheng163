## What's interesting about this article:**

In this article about tips that people give to the software enginneers. I found two advice that will be very helpful to me.

The fist advice is that I should have a portfolio of my software development work so it will be very beneficial for my future work, research, or making great resume.

The second is that I should read more books from sucessful software engineers so I can absorb the experience from them and grow quicker to become a qualified software engineer.

## Thoughts(Marcus)

I suppose that the first point is rather easy to achieve, given that we're all using github right now. The second point I find more admirable, as reading seems to become less accessible to many people nowadays. I admire your intent to read more though!
